    "In this Jupyter notebook, please, document your results and the way you have obtained them. You can use the attached yaml file to build Python environment for this assignment. Another option (and the easiest way) is to just use the _Python environment_ provided at the beginning of the course and then use *pip install* to install *p_decision_tree* library. You can find the required yaml file in the folder of this assignment. In addition to the _Jupyter notebook_, please submit _one zip-file_ containing all datasets and other outputs you have generated (such as pdf, jpg, and others). Please make sure that the datasets and other outputs are easily identifiable, i.e. use names as requested in the corresponding question.\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Security delay.</b> \n",
    "Security delay is caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of an aircraft because of a security breach, inoperative screening equipment, and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Weather delay.</b> \n",
    "Weather delay is caused by extreme or hazardous weather conditions that are forecasted or manifest themselves on point of departure, enroute, or on point of arrival.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Late aircraft delay.</b> \n",
    "Arrival delay at an airport due to the late arrival of the same aircraft at a previous airport. The ripple effect of an earlier delay at downstream airports is referred to as delay propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Taxi in/out.</b> \n",
    "Taxi time is the total time of an aircraft's movement on the ground.\n",

    "You heard from a friend that you are entitled to receive a payment of at least 150€ if your flight is delayed by more than 3 hours. Very excited, you are reminded of your IDS course and the flight dataset you had to analyze back then. You start to imagine a model trained on these flights that can predict if your future flights are delayed by three hours and, basically, allow you to travel the world for free if it chooses these flights correctly. You remember your IDS lecture and what you have to do to make your dream come true: You want to prepare the data accordingly, i.e., you model the target variable of being delayed by more than 3 hours and you choose and model the descriptive variable that you want to use for predicting delay. For the evaluation of your models, you have to choose an evaluation metric that describes whether the flights chosen by your model are actually delayed by <b> at least </b> 3 hours. Moreover, for the models, you want to train different regression, SVM, and neural network models with different parameters and find the best one. In the end, you should calculate for which flight price your model lets you travel the world for free.\n",
    "### Parts of this question:\n",
    "We want you to systematically approach the questions.
